#  baustelle.live

[baustelle.live](https://baustelle.live) is a hobby project by [Felix De Montis](https://felix.dm) / @dervondenbergen.

One of the construction sites of a new U2 subway station is up since 2020 until 2028 in the street crossing Lindengasse/Kirchengasse in Viennaâ€™s 7<sup>th</sup> district.

baustelle.live is a timelapse which will hopefully span all 8 years form two different camera perspectives, looking at each other.

This app is the companion to the page [latest.baustelle.live](https://latest.baustelle.live) that shows the current images from both cameras. In addition, the app also lists the previous timelapses for each camera.

The app exists mainly as a learning playground for SwiftUI and can be accessed via TestFlight here: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/hjJNYvO8](https://testflight.apple.com/join/hjJNYvO8)
